Buildout recipe for python-libevent
========================================================================

This buildout recipe can be used to build the python-libevent module and
link libevent itself statically.

Add the following section to your buildout script::

    [python-libevent]
    recipe = buildout.python_libevent
    eggs = python-libevent
    libevent = http://sourceforge.net/projects/levent/files/libevent/libevent-2.0/libevent-2.0.13-stable.tar.gz

"libevent" points to a released tarball of libevent which will be downloaded
and compiled using the regular "configure && make" and will be used to build
python-libevent.
